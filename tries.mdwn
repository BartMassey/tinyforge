# STrie

Simple search
[tries](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Trie)
over arbitrary keylists in Haskell. BSD licensed. Enjoy.

Compare and contrast with:

* The
[bytestring-trie](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bytestring-trie)
package. This package takes the name `Data.Trie` and
provides radix tries (aka PATRICIA tries) with `ByteString`
keys. I haven't benchmarked it, but it is likely to be much
faster than my thing. I will probably eventually make my
thing support the same interface.

* The [TrieMap](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/TrieMap)
package. This appears to be much, much more sophisticated
than my package. It is not well-documented, though, and I
haven't yet looked at how it works.
