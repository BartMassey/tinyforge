# LaTeX Style Tweaks

This is a collection of LaTeX micro-styles for achieving
some layout effects I commonly want:
  * blockpar.sty changes the paragraph style to block style
  * bigpage.sty sets reasonable page margins
  * blocktitle.sty sets the front matter in a left-justified
    compact style

You can get all these from git at
  * [git://svcs.cs.pdx.edu/git/latex-style-tweaks.git](http://svcs.cs.pdx.edu/gitweb?p=latex-style-tweaks.git;a=tree)
